Greetings once again, oh valiant <%= @current_line.author %>.
=============================================================

    Your fellow x-Quisite Corpseers out there in the wide world have finally congregated in such number and fashion as to produce the following outstanding collaborative work of art:
    <%= @first_line.text %>
    <% @first_line.later_lines.map do |later_line|%>
    <%= later_line.text %>
    <% end %>
    The first line of this creation was evoked from the mystery of the ether, but the remaining lines were forged by the following x-Quisite Corpseers respectively:
    <% @first_line.later_lines.map do |later_line|%>
    <%= later_line.author %>
    <% end %>
    If you're in an astute frame of mind today, <%= @current_line.author %>, you'll no doubt spot your name in this illustrious list of contributors, as well as your own proffered line of poetry: "<%= @current_line.text %>". What do you think, does it fit the overall flow of the x-Quisite Corpse? If not, then please do feel free to navigate back to x-Quisite Corpsing for another try.

May the rest of your day be no less superlative than the rest of your life - that is it, should you deserve so.
